A basic CRUD app built on the front end only

This demo app is for a user-generated driver ratings system. Originally, I intended it to to use a numerical system e.g. ELO for a more detailed rating system but in the interest of time, a simplified 5-star system was used.

It would connect to gMaps API to get cartesian distance between drivers but since it costs money, the movements are randomly generated.
The main table tracks drivers within a 2 mi radius. Poorly rated drivers are flagged in red and ideally a voice asst and/or map ping would notify the user when they're nearby.

Submissions for the demo use text entry but the intent is to have voice activated and image recognition integration such as through YOLO w/ OpenCV + character recognition to locate a car, narrow in on a license plate, and convert it to text so the user doesn't need to input through typing. 

Through partnering with car insurance and govt/edu, user incentives include discounts on insurance. Within the app, higher levels unlock better avatars and achievements (gamification). The public 'local cars' listing also creates peer incentive to drive well. Poor drivers would need to go to additional driver education to improve their score. For the younger crowd, it would reward good driving habits vs street racing to identify who is a good driver. 

This app was intended for mobile design or modern/future car computers. Rather than use a separate hardware device such as being tested by insurance companies today, it would use the cell phone's gyroscope sensor to detect sudden and rapid braking, excessive tangential acceleration indicating sharp turns, and sensing swerving vs staying in the center lane. 

When cars in the future all have cameras and more advanced computers, users can broadcast filtered messages within an area to detail issues. This is more constructive than honking or expressing road rage which no one really knows what the problem was until something bad happens or they get confrontational. A neutral tone voice assisted message would improve communications.

Additionally, transportation speed hasn't seen that much development compared to other fields. Hyperloop, Boring Co. are working on it, but suppose there were extra high speed lanes available only to good drivers, that would make travel faster today without building completely new infrastructure. If you think about it, if everyone drives even 100 mph synchronously, there should be no stop-go action and lags in between traffic. It would be smoother.
